# Project-Blizzard
Project created at Texas A&amp;M in 2016.

This project was a simulation of the events that happened in the novel "Seveneves" using HTML and Javascript. The simulation shows the earth and a ship orbiting it with multiple smaller ships following behind the larger one and asteroids that are crashing into earth. The simulation ends when either the ship or earth is destroyed and then displays the time (in seconds) the simulation ran. You can control the camera by holding left-click and moving the mouse around in the direction you want to rotate, but the camera will stay locked on earth.

There is an attached readme file which explains how to run the simulation along with the website.
